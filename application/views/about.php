    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to GrowOurYields LLC - a process that collects your on-farm decisions and outcomes in a summary form. We then compare your data to other local practice results recorded by your neighbors and report to you what approaches are working best to drive productivity and profitability. This system does not share your farm data with any other person, company or organization. Your information is secure and confidential. While other companies are securing information on your operation to profile you and your farm, GrowOurYields LLC is compiling on-farm performance on their products and services, and is your intelligence tool -- allowing you to make choices that best serve your needs on your farm.</p>

    <p>GrowOurYields LLC is now forming through a local farmer network in Northwestern Illinois and is farmer-directed and driven to allow it to quickly evolve to best serve the needs of its member farmers.</p>
